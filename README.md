# Different Things

- I have created a Tooltip for better visualization if have long text
- Instead to fetch all Records, just fetch record per schedule. I Believe is better a low loading about any schedule that have a huge loading for all records, which can have leave to several problems

# Things I could improve

- Remove all the Schedule Logic for Card to make him 100% reusable.
- Increase the theme file to have a higher standard (border radius, etc.)
- Better organize the commits (Commit per Component maybe)
- Test Helpers functions
- Improve UI - Being transparency, it's not my Strong Skills, so, to have a better UI I will probably create a FIGMA file, to help visualize a better UI.
